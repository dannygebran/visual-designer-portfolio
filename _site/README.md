Vertical version of a visual designer portfolio

This html / css project was developed as a second version of a personal portfolio.

This version has a traditional scroll down and navbar featuring responsiveness across devices powered by bootstrap.
CSS grid and flexbox are used for layout and images collapse. 
Horizontal and vertical alignment are done by CSS attributes.
Images are of my property and you can find more samples of my work at digitalchief.ie 

Shall have any question or advice please contact me on my email or Github page.

Regards.

Danny Gebran
